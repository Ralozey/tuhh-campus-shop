## Github

1. Fork this repository to create a copy of this in your 'Repositories'
2. Clone the forked repository to add changes
3. Test your changes and make sure that the server is executable
4. Create a Merge Request to add your changes to the main branch 

## Best Practice 

1. Branch naming convention 

   1. name it 'feature/ <feature-name>' to create a tree structure for your branches

2. Create an 'WIP: feature/<feature-name>' Merge Request, so others know what you are working on
